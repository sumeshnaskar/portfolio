                Hi! I am a software engineer with 2+ years of experience which I started with 
                the backend and later followed the HTML, CSS, and JS tradition before switching to React, 
                and since then, I have been looking for ways to showcase my abilities. 
                The projects in my portfolio and this website are all created using React.
