            Hi! I am a software engineer with 2+ years of experience who enjoys coding with a 
            mindset of a user rather than a developer. I started my journey with the backend and 
            was always curious about the frontend.
            I followed the HTML, CSS, and JS tradition before switching to React, 
            and since then, I have been looking for ways to showcase my abilities. 
            The projects in my portfolio and this website are all created using React.
